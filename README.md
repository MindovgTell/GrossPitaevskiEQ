# Gross-Pitaevskii Equation Solver

This project provides tools for numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, a nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation commonly used in Bose-Einstein condensate simulations. It implements both the Crank-Nicolson finite difference scheme and the Split Step method for efficient and accurate time evolution.

## Mathematical Formulation

The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with dipole-dipole interaction and quantum fluctuations is given by:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r}) + g |\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)|^2 + \Phi_{\text{dd}}(\mathbf{r}, t) + \gamma_{\text{QF}} |\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)|^3 \right] \psi(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

where:
- $\psi(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the condensate wavefunction,
- $V_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r})$ is the external potential,
- $g$ is the contact interaction strength,
- $\Phi_{\text{dd}}(\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the dipole-dipole interaction potential,
- $\gamma_{\text{QF}}$ is the quantum fluctuation coefficient.
